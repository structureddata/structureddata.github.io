[Glenn Fawcett](http://blogs.sun.com/glennf) has put together a nice slide deck entitled "[Oracle Analysis 101](http://blogs.sun.com/glennf/entry/oracle_analysis_101_begining_analysis)" that discusses techniques to collect and analyze performance data related to Oracle databases.  It's a good read so check it out.  Glenn is also a great resource for Oracle on [Sun Niagara 2 Processors (CMT)](http://www.sun.com/processors/niagara/) so be sure to peek at his other blog posts as well.
