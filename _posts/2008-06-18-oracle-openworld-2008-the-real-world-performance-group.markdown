With [Oracle OpenWorld 2008](http://www.oracle.com/openworld/2008/index.html) only a few months away, I thought I would take a moment to mention that the Real-World Performance Group will again be hosting three sessions.  If you were at the sessions last year, then you probably know how good they were.  If you didn't make it, you can check out [the recap](http://structureddata.org/2007/11/19/the-real-world-performance-group-oracle-openworld-2007-recap/) from last year's sessions.  Hope to see you there!

<td >This panel session includes the Real-World Performance Group and other invited performance experts. To make the hour as productive as possible, the panel needs to have your questions on the subject of real-world performance written up on a card and handed in at the beginning of the session. The panel will not conduct debugging of your system, discuss specific bugs, or port specific problems.

<td >In this session, the speaker gives his end-of-year schoolmaster’s report on database performance, which has challenged Oracle customers as well as the Real-World Performance Group. See if you are experiencing the same problems. Will you make the same mistakes, or perhaps you would like to learn from the experience of other users? The presentation, of interest to anyone from junior programmers to CTOs, addresses the usual areas of performance challenges in a direct, matter-of-fact manner.

<td >This session builds on the conclusions of the “Current Trends in Real World Database Performance” session (S298786). It is engineering-intensive, aimed at database experts responsible for designing, coding, and administering today’s databases. It focuses equally on online systems and data warehouse systems.
