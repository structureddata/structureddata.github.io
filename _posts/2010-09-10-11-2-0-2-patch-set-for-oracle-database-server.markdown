_Update: Mon Sep 13 16:02:36 PDT 2010 The 11.2.0.2 patch is now available for download (for real).  If you downloaded it on Friday, there is no need to re-download it.  It was mistakenly made public before it could be validated (test MD5 sums, etc.), but has since been validated.  Enjoy! _

Just a quick post that the 11.2.0.2 patch set for Oracle Database Server has been released for x86 and x86-64 platforms. The patchset number is [10098816](https://updates.oracle.com/ARULink/PatchDetails/process_form?patch_num=10098816) and is available for download from [My Oracle Support](https://support.oracle.com/). 

Be sure to give note 1189783.1 [Important Changes to Oracle Database Patch Sets Starting With 11.2.0.2](https://support.oracle.com/oip/faces/secure/km/DocumentDisplay.jspx?id=1189783.1) a read as several things have changed in the patching process.
