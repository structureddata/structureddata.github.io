The internet buzz seems to be that Larry Ellison, CEO, Oracle Corporation and John Fowler, EVP, Sun Microsystems, Inc. will be announcing a new product, the world's first OLTP database machine with Sun's brand new FlashFire technology on Tuesday, September 15, 2009, 1 p.m. PT.

Both Sun and Oracle have Webcast invitations on their websites:

- [Oracle Invitation](http://www.oracle.com/webapps/events/EventsDetail.jsp?p_eventId=101511)
- [Sun Invitation](http://www.sun.com/featured-articles/2009-0911/feature/index.jsp)

I plan on being at the Oracle Conference Center for the launch and will try and Tweet the highlights.  First Oracle Database 11g Release 2, now an OLTP database machine.  Are there more innovations up Oracle's sleeve?  I guess we'll have to wait and see.
