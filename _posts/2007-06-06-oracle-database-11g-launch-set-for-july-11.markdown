Today [Oracle ](http://www.oracle.com)announced that the Oracle Database 11g launch will take place in New York City on July 11th.  I'm quite excited about what 11g will bring to the table and after the public release I'll be blogging about the features and options I feel yield added performance and scalability.  Stay tuned!
