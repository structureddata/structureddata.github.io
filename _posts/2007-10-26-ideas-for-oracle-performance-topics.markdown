From time to time I get a little writer's block and sometime search for topics to blog about.  I thought, what better way to get ideas for blog posts than to ask the readers of this blog.  Here is your chance to influence  the topic of upcoming blog posts.  I just have a few requests to keep things orderly:

- Topics should in the context of the Oracle database and performance there of.
- It's not meant to be a Q & A, but rather the subject of a blog post.
- Try to say as much as necessary, with the least amount of words.
- It's not meant to be a alternative to [Oracle Support](http://www.oracle.com/support/) or [Ask Tom](http://asktom.oracle.com).
- Keep in mind it's for a blog post, not a white paper or dissertation.
- You get the gist...

Just a heads up: comments are moderated so don't be surprised if they don't show up immediately.  Thanks much for taking the time to post your ideas/comments!
