As I peek at the financial news this morning I see the headlines "[Oracle Buys Sun](http://news.google.com/news?hl=en&q=Oracle+Buys+Sun)".  More information can be found at [http://www.oracle.com/sun](http://www.oracle.com/sun).

Curt Monash has some [first thoughts](http://www.dbms2.com/2009/04/20/first-thoughts-on-oracle-acquiring-sun/) but I'll limit my comments at this time to "very interesting".  What do you think?  Good?  Bad?  Otherwise?
