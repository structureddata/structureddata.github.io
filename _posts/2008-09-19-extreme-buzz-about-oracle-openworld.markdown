Last week I read [Mark Rittman's post](http://www.rittmanmead.com/2008/09/12/so-what-is-oracles-new-database-accelerator/) and today I was reading [this InfoWorld article](http://www.infoworld.com/article/08/09/18/OpenWorld_nears_some_info_on_Oracle_11g_R2_database_emerges_1.html) and a few others that are speculating what will be the big news this year at [Oracle OpenWorld](http://www.oracle.com/openworld/).

I guess the first teaser was given out by Larry Ellison on [the F4Q08 earnings call on June 25](http://seekingalpha.com/article/82717-oracle-f4q08-qtr-end-5-31-08-earnings-call-transcript?page=-1):

> We have a major database innovation that we will announce in September of this year. It is going to be a very big and important announcement for us, so we are not standing still in database.

Then [on today's earnings call ](http://seekingalpha.com/article/96246-oracle-f1q09-qtr-end-8-31-08-earnings-call-transcript?page=-1)for F1Q09 Charles Phillips mentions:

> There will be an additional 11g update this quarter. It will contain some ease of use enhancements and a major dimension to the product line to be discussed next week. It’s more than a feature, let’s say -- it puts Oracle into a new segment of the database market, which should help us sustain the consistent market share gains we’ve enjoyed the last several years, so if you want to hear the details, please come on out to OpenWorld in San Francisco next week.

So what is Oracle's new [database accelerator](http://www28.cplan.com/cc208/catalog.jsp?ilc=208-1&ilg=english&isort_sessions=&isort_demos=&isort_exhibitors=&is=yes&ip=%3C%2Fipresentations%3E&isort_sessions_type=&isort_exhibitors_type=&isort_demos_type=&search_sessions=yes&icriteria1=+&icriteria2=+&icriteria5=+&icriteria8=&icriteria9=+&icriteria6=&icriteria3=+&icriteria7=Database+Accelerator)?  How will [query processing be revolutionized](http://www28.cplan.com/cc208/session_details.jsp?isid=298677&ilocation_id=208-1&ilanguage=english)?  I guess we'll all have to wait for [Larry Ellison's keynote](http://www.oracle.com/openworld/2008/keynotes.html#ellison) entitled "Extreme. Performance." on Wednesday, September 24 at 2:30 p.m. to find out.
