[Oracle OpenWorld 2007](http://www.oracle.com/openworld/2007/index.html) has come and gone and from the Real-World Performance Group's perspective we'd consider it a successful one.  The content of this year's presentations seems to have gone over quite well as shown by the number of hallway comments and emails we received.  At least two Oracle bloggers have put up their thoughts on the sessions:

- [**Doug Burns**](http://oracledoug.com/serendipity): [OOW - Day 4 - Performance Day](http://oracledoug.com/serendipity/index.php?/archives/1353-OOW-Day-4-Performance-Day.html) and [OOW Day 5](http://oracledoug.com/serendipity/index.php?/archives/1357-OOW-Day-5.html)
- [**Andrew Clarke**](http://radiofreetooting.blogspot.com): [OOW2K7: The Real World Performance Group](http://radiofreetooting.blogspot.com/2007/11/oow2k7-real-world-performance-group.html)

Many thanks to both Doug and Andrew for the nice write-ups and the kind words, as well as those of you who attended the sessions.  We hope to see you next year!
