Now that [Oracle OpenWorld 2010](http://www.oracle.com/us/openworld/index.htm) is just under 70 days away I thought I would take a moment to mention that the Oracle Real-World Performance Group will again be hosting three sessions.   This year I think we have a very exciting and informative lineup of sessions that are a must-attend for those wanting to see and hear Oracle Database performance insight right from Oracle's own performance engineers.  Hope to see you there!

And for those who are interested, there will likely be many discussions about the [Oracle Database Machine](http://www.oracle.com/database/database-machine.html) and [Oracle Exadata](http://www.oracle.com/us/products/database/exadata/index.htm).  Very hot stuff!

All topics discussed in this session come from the Real-World Performance Group's observations and problem solving.﻿</td>

Wouldn't you like to know all the performance secrets they know? In this session, real-world database performance engineers will go over many of the performance secrets they use to get extreme performance out of Oracle Database. Not only will they tell you about these secrets but they will demo them for you as well. This session is specifically for those wanting to advance their database performance knowledge and experience.﻿</td>
