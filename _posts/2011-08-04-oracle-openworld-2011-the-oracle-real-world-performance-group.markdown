The summer is flying by and in no time it will be October and that means [Oracle OpenWorld 2011](http://www.oracle.com/openworld) should be on your radar. Once again the Oracle Real-World Performance Group will be hosting three sessions.  For those unfamiliar with our presentations, you will get marketing free, no nonsense performance insight of the highest caliber from Oracle's most elite database performance engineers -- the kind of things hard core Oracle people want to hear about.  Hope to see you there!

            <td style="cursor:text;margin:8px;">Today the motivation to consolidate and migrate existing data and applications into the extreme-high-performance database environments of Oracle Exadata and Oracle Exalogic is being driven by a desire to reduce costs and deliver increased performance and service levels to users. The process is often called a forklift migration, because applications and data are simply picked up and lifted onto new platforms.In this session, Oracle's Real World Performance group describes how best to maximize your investment and achieve world-class performance and discusses the challenges and compromises that need to be made in the process.</td>
