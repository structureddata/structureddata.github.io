Yesterday Oracle Corporation had its earnings call for F3Q2009.  [On the call](http://seekingalpha.com/article/126708-oracle-corporation-f3q09-qtr-end-02-28-09-earnings-call-transcript?page=-1) Larry and Charles mention a few of the Exadata performance numbers observed.

Larry Ellison:

> ...looking forward, I think the most exciting product we’ve had in many, many years is our Exadata Database Server...
> 
> Exadata is 100% innovation on top of our very large and very strong database business. And the early results have been remarkable. Charles Phillips will go into a lot of detail but I’ll just throw a couple of numbers out there.
> 
> One of our customers, and Charles will describe this customer, one of our customers saw a 28x performance improvement over an existing Oracle database. Another customer saw a monthly aggregation drop from 4.5 hours just to 3 minutes.
> 
> When compared to Teradata, a competitive database machine that’s been in the market for a very, very long time, another customer saw that we were 6x faster than their existing Teradata application, when using Exadata versus Teradata.
> 
> Another customer saw a batch process fall from 8 hours to 30 minutes. Charles will go into more detail on all this, he will repeat those numbers, because I think they’re worth mentioning twice.

Charles Phillips:

> On databases, Larry mentioned, we’re very excited about how the HP Oracle database machine is performing. The increases have just been stunning and so we are getting great feedback from our customers and the pipeline is the largest build I’ve ever seen in terms of a new product.
> 
> And as he mentioned, the numbers are just stunning. The major European retailer who reduced the batch processing time from 8 hours to 30 minutes did not believe the process had completed. We had to convince him that’s actually how it’s done.
> 
> And so, as Larry mentioned, this is the reminder that this is an internally developed technology in the midst of all the discussion of acquisitions. People forget that we’re actually spending $3.0 billion a year on research and development and this is why we do it.

I agree with Larry 100%.  Exadata is the most exciting product and from a database performance engineer perspective (and a hardware junkie) it is quite amazing to see a single 42U rack of HP Oracle Database Machine rip and tear through terabytes of data as if it were breaking the laws of physics.  Quite exciting indeed.
