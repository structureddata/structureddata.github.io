As [Oracle OpenWorld](http://www.oracle.com/us/openworld/index.htm) is just around the corner and you are probably getting your session schedule together, I thought I'd pass on this (nearly complete) [list of sessions](http://bit.ly/oow10_oaktable) of which one or more of the presenters is an [OakTable member](http://oaktable.net/).  There is no doubt in my mind that these sessions will contain some of the best technical content presented at OpenWorld so be sure and pre-register for these sessions today.

Hope to see you there!
