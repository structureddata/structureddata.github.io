One of the less "traditional" tracks at [Oracle OpenWorld](http://www.oracle.com/us/openworld/index.htm) is the [Oracle Unconference](http://wiki.oracle.com/page/Oracle+OpenWorld+Unconference).  The Unconference allows for a much more informal setting for sessions and generally is more interactive and audience driven compared to the usually amounts of PowerPoint sessions contain which can cause eyes to bleed.  This year I've signed up to give a session at the Unconference entitled **_Chalk & Talk: The Core Performance Fundamentals of Oracle Data Warehousing_**.  This session will be a PowerPoint free session (hence Chalk & Talk) and it will be a very engineering heavy discussion around what techniques I use with customer POCs and VLDB databases and why I use those techniques.  If you are a DBA that supports an Oracle data warehouse, especially a VLDB Oracle data warehouse, I think this session will give you some great insight on how to deal with performance challenges you may face.  Topics that will be discussed will include partitioning, parallel execution, compression, statistics collection, Exadata, bulk data loads, ETL/ELT just to name a few.  Bring your questions and join in the discussion.  Hope to see you there!
