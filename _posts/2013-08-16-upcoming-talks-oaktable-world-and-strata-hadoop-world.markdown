I haven't had much time over the past year to do many blog posts, but in the next few months I'll be doing a few talks about what I've been working on over that time, [Cloudera Impala](http://cloudera.com/impala), an Open Source MPP SQL query engine for Hadoop.  Hope to see you at one of them.

[OakTable World](http://dboptimizer.com/oaktable-world/) - September 23-24, 2013, San Francisco, CA SQL on Hadoop - 11:00am Tuesday, September 24th.

[Strata + Hadoop World](http://strataconf.com/stratany2013) - October 28-30, 2013, New York, NY [Practical Performance Analysis and Tuning for Cloudera Impala](http://strataconf.com/stratany2013/public/schedule/detail/30551) - 2:35pm Wednesday, October 30th.
