This week (on Tuesday I believe) the 11.1.0.7 patch set for Oracle Database Server was released for for the "big 3" Unix platforms as I call them: Sun Solaris SPARC 64, HP-UX Itanium, and IBM AIX 64-bit.  The patchset number is [6890831](https://updates.oracle.com/ARULink/PatchDetails/process_form?patch_num=6890831&release=80111070&plat_lang=226P&patch_num_id=1006979) and is available for download from [Metalink](https://metalink.oracle.com/).
