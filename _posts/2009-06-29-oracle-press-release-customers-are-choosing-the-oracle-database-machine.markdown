Oracle put out a press release today entitled ["Customers are Choosing the Oracle Database Machine"](http://www.oracle.com/us/corporate/press/020542) mentioning the new Exadata and Oracle Database Machine customers.  I've quoted a few parts of it below.  Oracle cites twenty initial customers.

### Initial Customers

> Initial Oracle Exadata customers including Amtrak, Allegro Group, Automobile Association of the UK, CTC, Garanti Bank, Giant Eagle, HISCOM (Hokuriku Coca Cola), KnowledgeBase Marketing, Loyalty Partner Solutions, M-Tel, MTN Group, Nagase, NS Solutions, NTT Data, OK Systems, Research in Motion, SoftBank Mobile, Screwfix, ThomsonReuters, and True Telecom, confirm the benefits [Oracle Exadata products](http://www.oracle.com/solutions/business_intelligence/exadata.html) bring to their Oracle data warehouses.


### Supporting Quotes

> "The HP Oracle Database Machine beat the competing solutions we tested on bandwidth, load rate, disk capacity, and transparency.  In addition, Allegro Group saw a significant performance boost from the new data warehouse.  A query that used to take 24 hours to complete now runs in less than 30 minutes on the HP Oracle Database Machine, and that’s without any manual query tuning." **-- Christian Maar, CIO of Poznań, Poland-based Allegro Group**

> "After carefully testing various options for a new data warehouse platform we chose the HP Oracle Database Machine over Netezza.  Oracle Exadata was able to speed up one of our critical processes from days to minutes.  The HP Oracle Database Machine will allow us to improve service levels and expand our service offerings.  We also plan to consolidate our current data warehouse solutions onto the Oracle Exadata platform.  This should eliminate several servers and a number of storage arrays and help reduce our operating overhead and improve margins."  **-- Brian Camp, Sr. VP of Infrastructure Services, KnowledgeBase Marketing**

> "We anticipate the move of our Data Warehouse to Oracle Database 11g running on our first HP Oracle Database Machine with Oracle Exadata will deliver a substantial boost in performance and scalability, simply and easily. Our business users expect to benefit from faster access to information more quickly than ever before.  The resulting agility should make a huge difference to our business." **-- Andreas Berninger, Chief Operating, Loyalty Partner Solutions**

> "The biggest technological challenge we face when we architect a database is how to create a system that performs fast with huge volumes.  Oracle Exadata helps solve our performance demands.  It's highly available and reliable, and it can essentially scale linearly.  All of the queries we tested were faster with Oracle Exadata.  The smallest performance boost we experienced was 10 times; the fastest was 72 times faster." **-- Plamen Zyumbyulev, Head of Database Administration, M-Tel**

> "A key component of RIM's manufacturing process is extensive testing of each handheld device. This testing generates large volumes of data, which is extensively analyzed by our quality and test engineers and business users to ensure RIM is producing the highest quality devices for our customers.  The HP Oracle Database Machine is an ideal platform to store and analyze this data since it provides the performance, scalability and storage capacity for our requirements.  It’s a cost-effective platform to meet our speed and scalability needs and is an integral component used for analysis in our manufacturing process." **-- Ketan Parekh, Manager Database Systems, Research in Motion**

> "The benchmark result of Oracle Exadata was amazing!  Since it is based on Oracle Database 11g, we determined that it is compatible with other systems and the most suitable solution for our increasing data infrastructure."** -- Keiichiro Shimizu, General Manager, Business Base Management Dept., Information System Div., SoftBank Mobile Corp.**

> "Oracle Exadata is among the most successful new product introductions in Oracle's history," said Willie Hardie, vice president of Database Product Marketing, Oracle. "Repeatedly in customer proof of concepts and benchmarks, Oracle Exadata has delivered extreme performance for customers' data warehouses."
