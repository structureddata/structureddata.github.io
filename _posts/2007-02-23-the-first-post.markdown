Up until this point the only public information sharing I have done has been via the Real-World Performance Round-table discussions at [Oracle OpenWorld](http://www.oracle.com/openworld) and, most recently, at the [NoCOUG](http://nocoug.org) Winter Conference.  Going forward I would like to use this blog as an additional channel for discussions with the Oracle user community.

Just a bit of background on me... I've been a member of the Real World Performance Group at [Oracle](http://oracle.com) since 2004 and I have worn the DBA and Systems/Storage Admin hats prior to that.  My role in the Real-World Performance Group is that of a database performance engineer.  I have been concentrating on data warehousing and spend most of my time doing data warehouse benchmarks for customers that have varied in size from 1TB to more than 70TB.   I've also worked on OLTP benchmarks as well as performance related escalations.
