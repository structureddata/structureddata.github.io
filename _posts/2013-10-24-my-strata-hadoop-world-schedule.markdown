Next week is [Strata + Hadoop World](http://strataconf.com/stratany2013) which is bound to be exciting for those who deal with big data on a daily basis.  I'll be spending my time talking about [Cloudera Impala](http://cloudera.com/impala) at various places so I'm posting my schedule for those interesting in catching about fast SQL on Hadoop.  Hope to see you there!
