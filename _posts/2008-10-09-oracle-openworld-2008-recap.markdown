[Oracle OpenWorld 2008](http://www.oracle.com/openworld/2008/index.html) is now in the books and it surely was a busy and exciting one.  The launch of [Oracle Exadata Storage Server](http://www.oracle.com/solutions/business_intelligence/exadata.html) and the [HP Oracle Database Machine](http://www.oracle.com/solutions/business_intelligence/database-machine.html) was the highlight for me and I hope for many of you as well.

### Real-World Performance Group Presentations

This year the Real-World Performance Group did [three sessions](/2008/06/18/oracle-openworld-2008-the-real-world-performance-group/) and the slides for those sessions have been uploaded to the [OpenWorld Content Catalog](http://www28.cplan.com/cc208/login.jsp) as well as the [presentations page](/presentations/) on my blog.  Hopefully you were able to attend the sessions and found them informative and had some good take-aways.  If you did not attend, the slides are available for your reading enjoyment.  If you have any questions, please post a comment.
