In catching up on blog posts I see that [Jonathan Lewis](http://jonathanlewis.wordpress.com/2009/09/05/11gr2/), [Christian Antognini](http://antognini.ch/2009/09/deferred-segment-creation/) and [Nuno Souto](http://dbasrus.blogspot.com/2009/09/11gr2-it-looks-like-someone-is.html) picked up on the deferred segment creation new feature in Oracle 11gR2.  In keeping with the theme, I thought I'd put together the top 10 new features in Oracle Database 11g Release 2 (11.2) that I consider significant.

In future posts I'll dive into some of these in more technical detail but for now I thought I'd throw my list out there to raise awareness of the things I am looking at as a database performance engineer.
