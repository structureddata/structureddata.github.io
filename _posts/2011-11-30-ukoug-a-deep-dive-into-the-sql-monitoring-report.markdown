The [UK Oracle User Group Conference 2011](http://techandebs.ukoug.org/) is just around the corner and I just realized that I haven't yet highlighted this, other than the "I'm speaking" banner on my blog.  I'll be speaking on one of my favorite and most used reports -- the SQL Monitor Report.  Below are the session details [[direct link](http://2011.ukoug.org/default.asp?p=8850&dlgact=shwprslist&prs_prsid=6660)].  Hope to see you there!

            <td valign="top">The SQL Monitoring Report was introduced in Oracle Database 11g and has become the single most used diagnostic report by the Oracle Real-World Performance Group and Oracle database development for SQL statement performance issues. This session will start with a technical overview of the SQL Monitoring Report and what metrics and information it provides. From there we'll deep dive into numerous examples from the field explaining how this report was used to diagnose and validate performance issues. There is a wealth of information in the SQL Monitoring Report and this session will provide the necessary knowledge to best leverage it. </td>
