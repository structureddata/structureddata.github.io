This weekend begins Oracle's [OpenWorld](http://www.oracle.com/openworld) and there is something off the beaten path going on -- [OakTable World](http://oaktableworld.com/).  There  is a pretty good lineup of speakers, including myself, who will be talking on subjects that probably would not qualify for OpenWorld sessions for various reasons.  My talk is entitled "Beyond the Relational Database" and in it I'll be talking about non-relational (Big Data) technologies and what they have to offer.  Be sure to bring an open mind!  Hope to see you there.
