Back on June 17th [WordPress 3.0 "Thelonious"](http://wordpress.org/news/2010/06/thelonious/) was released and it offered up a handful of new features. Just a few days ago (July 29th) the [3.0.1 release went GA](http://wordpress.org/news/2010/07/wordpress-3-0-1/) so I decided it was time to investigate what the new 3.0 ready themes had to offer. After looking through a handful of themes I decided to give the [Magazine Basic](http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/magazine-basic) theme a try for now. It offered a 1024 pixel wide layout and threaded comments; two of the features I was really looking for.  Feel free to share your comments: good, bad or otherwise.  Thanks!

Here is a capture of the previous version just in case you don't recall what it looked like (click for full size).
