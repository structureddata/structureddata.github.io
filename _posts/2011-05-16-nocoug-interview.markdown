Since I've been on a blogging hiatus for the past few months (and hopefully that will change shortly) I thought I'd mention that the inverview I did with the famous [Gwen (Chen) Shapira](http://twitter.com/gwenshap) has now been published in the May 2011 [_NoCOUG Journal_](http://www.nocoug.org/Journal/NoCOUG_Journal_201105.pdf).  Hopefully you find it interesting and insightful.  Feel free to leave me a comment on your thoughts.
