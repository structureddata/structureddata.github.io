It's that time again -- time to figure out what sessions you will be attending at [Oracle OpenWorld 2011](http://www.oracle.com/openworld/index.html).  In my slightly biased opinion, session by members of the [OakTable Network](http://www.oaktable.net/) generally have great technical content and give you the most value for your time.  To aid you with your scheduling, I've compiled a list of sessions by OakTable members [here](http://bit.ly/oow11_oaktable).  Enjoy!
