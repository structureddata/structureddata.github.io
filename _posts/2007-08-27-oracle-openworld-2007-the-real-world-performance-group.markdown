For those of you who will be attending Oracle OpenWorld 2007 and have interests in the database performance area, I would recommend to you to try and attend the Real-World Performance Group Roundtable session.  The session starts with a brief "Hot List" of performance issues that have been predominant in the field over the last year and then the panel will be taking questions collected from the audience.

<table width="100%" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="3">
    <tr>
        <td bgcolor="BBBBBB" class="bodycopy" colspan="2" align="center">Session Details</td>
    </tr>

    </tr>

        <td class="bodycopy"> In this annual database performance review from the Real-World Performance Group, a discussion of today's issues precedes a panel discussion in which the audience is invited to debate today's challenges, including the following: optimizer plans and management, I/O issues, session and cursor management, effective system architectures, and capacity planning.
