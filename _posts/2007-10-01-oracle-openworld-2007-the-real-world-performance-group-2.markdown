Andrew Holdsworth, the Senior Director of the Real-World Performance Group, will be having two presentation sessions at [Oracle OpenWorld 2007](http://www.oracle.com/openworld/2007/index.html), in addition to the [Real-World Performance Group Roundtable session](http://www28.cplan.com/cc176/session_details.jsp?isid=291306&ilocation_id=176-1&ilanguage=english). The first presentation is [Current Trends in Database Performance](http://www28.cplan.com/cc176/session_details.jsp?isid=291301&ilocation_id=176-1&ilanguage=english) and the second one is [When to Use the Appropriate Database Technology](http://www28.cplan.com/cc176/session_details.jsp?isid=291304&ilocation_id=176-1&ilanguage=english). Full session details are below. The content of these presentations has come from the Real-World Performance Group's customer interactions over the past year. I would encourage all of you who want to get the best performance out of your Oracle Database to consider attending. Hope to see you there!

        <td> This session reinforces good database design practices. With so many database features available in Oracle Database 10g and 11g, architects and programmers are faced with these questions: How do I implement something, and which technologies should I use? This session defines when to use various occasionally overlapping and complementary technologies to achieve a reliable, high-performing design. </td>
