I've decided it was time for a new look for Structured Data so I've updated the theme.  I think I have looked at enough posts and all looks well but if you find something that appears odd, unreadable or otherwise, do let me know by posting a comment on this thread and include the link to the problematic post.

One of the main reasons I chose this theme was for the java script that allows links back to a comment that one has replied to as well as the option to quote previous comments as well.  On the down side the Trackbacks are hidden by default and one has to choose either Trackbacks or Comments to be viewed.  I may modify this as time permits. _Time came sooner than I had originally anticipated._

Feel free to leave a comment with your thoughts, especially if you think this version of the site lacks something the previous version had.
